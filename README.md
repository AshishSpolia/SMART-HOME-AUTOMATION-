🏠 Ultimate Hub 2.0: Integrated IoT Safety & Radar SystemUltimate Hub 2.0 is an advanced ESP32-based ecosystem designed for real-time environmental monitoring, hazard mitigation, and interactive spatial visualization. It transforms a standard microcontroller into a professional-grade smart controller capable of managing complex sensor arrays and high-voltage appliances through a high-performance web dashboard.🚀 Core FeaturesIntelligent Safety Automation: Monitors MQ-7 (CO), MQ-8 (Hydrogen), and Flame sensors to trigger an automated exhaust fan and buzzer response.Live Radar Mapping: Utilizes an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor on a Servo to render a 180° spatial map on an HTML5 Canvas.Dynamic Web Dashboard: A mobile-responsive "Cyberpunk" interface for real-time telemetry and 8-channel relay control without page reloads.Pro Lux Lighting: A dedicated engine for a WS2812B NeoPixel ring with multiple animation modes (Rainbow, Heartbeat, Lightning).Non-Blocking Logic: Engineered using millis() timing to ensure simultaneous sensor polling, radar movement, and web server stability.🔌 Hardware ConfigurationComponentESP32 PinFunctionDHT22GPIO 4Temp/Humidity SensingMQ-7GPIO 34Carbon Monoxide DetectionMQ-8GPIO 35Hydrogen/Smoke DetectionFlame SensorGPIO 27Fire DetectionBuzzerGPIO 25Audio AlarmServo MotorGPIO 18Radar SweepUltrasonic TrigGPIO 5Distance TriggerUltrasonic EchoGPIO 19Distance EchoNeoPixel RingGPIO 2Lighting EffectsRelay 2GPIO 12Exhaust Fan Control🛠️ Installation & SetupLibraries Required: Install the following via the Arduino Library Manager:DHT sensor libraryESP32ServoAdafruit NeoPixelNetwork Setup: Update the ssid and password variables in the code to match your WiFi credentials.Deployment: Upload the .ino code to your ESP32 and open the Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to find the local IP address.
